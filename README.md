# Stooq-for-Finance-Quote
A [Finance::Quote](https://github.com/finance-quote/finance-quote) module (Perl), which retrieves financial data from [Stooq.pl](https://stooq.pl) website. It exposes asset's: name, price, open, high, low, close/last, ask, bid, volume and date/isodate/time of retrieval.

# Installation
Download file `Stooq.pm` and paste it into Finance::Quote directory (probably `<perl_dir>\site\lib\Finance\Quote`). Then add string `Stooq` (preferably in alphabetical order) to the `@MODULES` variable in `Quote.pm`.

# PLN only
Firstly, Stooq provides financial data for various assets but it never tells the asset's currency. (And I think it isn't likely to change soon, as I asked them). Secondly, the original author wrote this module because he needed to get financial data about Polish stock market. Due to this, the currency 'PLN' is hardcoded into the module and any request for financial data of a non-PLN asset will provide wrong information and may break your data.

# Unofficial
The module is unofficial. And it won't become official until Stooq adds the stock's currency to it's financial data in API response. You can read details in [Finance::Quote's bug #203](https://github.com/finance-quote/finance-quote/issues/203).

# Authors
The module isn't written by me. The file comes from [CPAN Bug Tracker â€“ Bug #64474 for Finance-Quote: New module suggestion for Warsaw Stock Exchange (stooq.com)](https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=64474), where his name is removed. Although, in the source code one may notice a name 'Michal Fita', so maybe it's him. Thanks!
